# auTor

This project is created for the purpose of enabling tor bridge mode on cli-terminal enviroment. 

I know that browser-version already have such as obfs4 bridge mode, but cli-terminal doesn't have by default. 

This script is heavily inspired by the blackbox.org author <<gitrepo>>. 
  
The script will have the following features below.

1. bleachbit : to clean garbage/cache files on the system to better security.
2. apt update packages : make sure that the packages are up-to-date. 
3. tor + bridge mode : this will enable more anonymous surfing and avoid blacklist IP address.
